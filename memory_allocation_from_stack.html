my code: https://github.com/chillancezen/ZeldaOS/blob/master/memory/malloc.c#L276

Allocating memory from the procedure stack is much more efficient and like any other pre-allocated
space, the space will be freed when procedure returns. the principle is simple: push the stack downwards
for a length. the user should be aware: after you allocate memory from stack, you can not operate more
of instruction-level push-pops which spans the allocated space.

with x86(x86_64), it's easy to do the stack space preservation(pseudo code):
   size_to_alloc = rounded(size_to_alloc);
   asm: %RSP -= size_to_alloc;


but what if you are going to realize the stack allocation in a C language function? this becomes a
little more complex because it involves another procedure invocation.

for a typical procedure invocation with SystemV ABI calling covention, we have:
   push   %rbp
   movq   %rsp, %rbp
   ... ... ...
   movq   %rbp, %rsp
   popq   %rbp
   retq

the last two instructions before 'retq' can be shortened to 'leaveq'. before procedure returns,
if we hornor the calling convention, the last chance to modify the caller's stack pointer is
'movq   %rbp, %rsp', and after return, the %RBP is restored to the caller's one  but %RSP is
modified to an extended one.

next I will give a figure on how I do it.

                                    PROC rerturns:
                                    RAX := allocated memory pointer
                                    RSP := mangled RBP
                                    RBP := caller's RBP


the core algorithm is to move the caller's calling stub to a lower place, and return to
the caller. but the caller's %RSP is modified by the callee.

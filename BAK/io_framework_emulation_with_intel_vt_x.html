There are two IO channels in x86_64: PIO and MMIO. MMIO is the memory mapped IO channel with which you can use generic data
instructions to access IO devices registers/memory except that these memory areas have different paging requirements: for example,
the device memory area is non-cacheable.any write to the area is flushed immediately. PIO has seperate address space and exclusive
IO instructions. as far as I know, other ISA like ARM does not have PIO, all the devices are mapped in memory address space.

as you may guess, x86_64 has exclusive IO instruction, the vt-x could intercepts IO instructions and cause a vm exit. the bit 24 and
25 of primary processor based execute control is controlling the IO instruction behaviors(see 24.6.2.): when unconditional IO exiting bit(bit 24)
is set, bit 25 is ignored, any IO instructions can cause vm exit. when conditional IO exiting(bit 25) is set, two bitmaps should be set to give vmx 
indication on how which port address causes a vm exit while others do not. the format of the IO bitmap can be found at 24.6.4.
the basic reason for IO exits is 30. and the qualification can be found in Table 27.5 in SDM.

MMIO in vt-x is much more complex, as a matter of fact, vt-x does not provide any native methods which lets your guest trap into vmx when your guest
is accessing the so called MMIO memory area. instead, at vmx EPT layer(assume we are exploting vt-x Extended Page Table for address translation) vmx
does not distinguish the system memory and device memory. it even does not trap into vmx if the ept is filled as good as it expects.
the EPT entry is completely different from normal table entry: it has no bit filed entry: present. every entry takes 8 bytes. bit 0 is read access and
bit 1 is write access, you can find full format of the ept entry at 28.2.2.
normally, if an entry is marked as non-readable and non-writable, access to the target area cause EPT violation exit(reason number 48). and if
the entry is marked as non-readable but writable, memory access to that area will cause EPT misconfiguration exit(reason number 49).

now we know how EPT behaves. we are going to fill entries for the MMIO regions as non-readable and writable intentionally. thus vmx traps get EPT
misconfiguration basic reason, we can examine the devices associated that address, and then do IO work for the device.

a very typical case for MMIO is 16-color video device emulation: any writes to the physical page: 0xb8000 will refect on the video monitor. 
the reference implementation in my hypervisor is in vm_monitor/device_video.c. there is one exception: the video base address is set 0x1000b8000
because I reserve the low 1MB memory space for my guest image.
as you can see, the video device initialization process is quite straightforward:
    setup_io_memory(vm->regions.ept_pml4_base, VIDEO_BUFFER_PAGE_FRAME);
    struct mmio_operation video_mmio = {
        .addr_low = VIDEO_BUFFER_PAGE_FRAME,
        .addr_high = VIDEO_BUFFER_PAGE_FRAME + PAGE_SIZE_4K,
        .mmio_read = video_buffer_mmio_read,
        .mmio_write = video_buffer_mmio_write
    };
    register_mmio_operation(&video_mmio);

one problem that makes me headache is in EPT misconfiguration exit, nothing about the instruction is given to you except for the guest physical address.
so you have to decode the instruction yourself to determine the source/destionation operand and the instruction length with which we can advance guest RIP.
I decoded several basic move instructions in vm_monitor/vmx_instruction_decoding.c.

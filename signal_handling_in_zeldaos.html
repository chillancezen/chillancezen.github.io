Signal is a mechanism for kenrel to interrupt userworld task, like the way the device interrupts
processor, kernel is able to interrupt a task in a asynchronous way. Linux supports posix real-time
signals, however, in my ZeldaOS, only reliable signals are supported, that means the signals may be
delayed a bit. 

when kernel is signalling the task, signals are pending until being scheduled next
time irregardless of the status of that task: when the task is running in privilege level 3, the signal
is postponed until the context is switched to kernel world(privilege level 0) and right at the moment
when being about to switch back to user space.

it requires that the code of user context must give up proceeding when signal is pending, a very typical code
snippet in ZeldaOS is when the task is sleeping:
    int32_t
    sleep(uint32_t milisecond)
    {
        int ret = OK;
        struct timer_entry timer;
        memset(&timer, 0x0, sizeof(timer));
        ASSERT(current);
        timer.state = timer_state_idle;
        timer.time_to_expire = jiffies + milisecond;
        timer.priv = current;
        timer.callback = sleep_callback;
        register_timer(&timer);
        transit_state(current, TASK_STATE_INTERRUPTIBLE);
        yield_cpu();
        if (signal_pending(current)) {
            cancel_timer(&timer);
            ret = -ERR_INTERRUPTED;
        }
        ASSERT(timer_detached(&timer));

        return ret;
    }

as you can see from the above code, it's quite simple to let the a task sleep for a bit time, what we have to do
is put a timer into global timer scheduling queue, thus when the timer expires, the task can be waken up.
but when the signal is pending, the task can also be awake, the task have to examine whether the task is
signalled. being signalled is not that expected in normal process, but we must handle this.

you may wonder why the task must quit its kernel context before signals are processed, that's becasue processing signals
may change the flow of normal context, for example, it can terminate the task and there should be no on-stack data structures
being refereneced by kernel subordinary components. for example, the timer entry is allocated from task PL0 stack, if the
task happens to be terminated without normally quitting kernel context, the kernel timer subsystem can reference invalid memory
area, this is absolutely not expected.

as for the stack on which signal context code runs, I prepare a dedicated stack so it avoid the complexity of stack management and
also reduces the chance to damage the normal stack. the below diagram shows the stack usage and signal processing flow.

from scheduler's perspective, the signal-pending is examined at the exit from kernel world to user world, if the signal is
pending and the action is to directed to registered user code, it then switchs to the signal handler which runs at previlege
level 3, after the handler is totally completed, it must swtch back to kernel user and the normal process resumes. but how?

there are several ways to do it as far as I know, for example: we could direct the post-signal-handler to the code area which
which contains an dedicated system call to terminate the signal handler calling. in ZeldaOS, I took the other way:
          signal handler()      signal dedicated stack
            +-------+           +---------+
            |-------|           |         |
            |-------|           |         |
            |-------|           |         |
            |-------|           +---------+
            |-------|           |  EIP    |(fabricated EIP
            |-------| +-------> +---------+ pointing to the
            |-------| |         |  EBP    | return_from_pl3_signal_handler() in PL0)
            +-------+ |         +---------+
    +-----+ | ret   | |         |   .     |
    |       +-------+ |         |   .     |
    |                 |         |   .     |
    |     EIP <= signal_handler |   .     |
    |                           +---------+
    |                           |         |
    |
    |
    +--------------->After the instruction 'ret', the return address is poped from
                     the stack, however the memory address is not accessible in PL3
                     so we encounter the paging permission fault, but we know it is
                     caused by signal handling if we compare the linear address of
                     paging fault with the return_from_pl3_signal_handler

this is a little tricky because we fill the EIP of last frame to the memory address which is inaccessible in privilege
level 3, and we exploit paging mechanism to intercept the event of signal handler.
